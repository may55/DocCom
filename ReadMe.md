```

Install all required dependencies in an isolated environment

```
cd rengorum/backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy the `.env.example` as `.env` in `backend` folder
```
cp .env.example .env
```

Install all required dependencies for frontend in rengorum/frontend folder by typing

```

## Running Backend on Local Server

Activate virtual environment

```
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
```

(Optional) Run test
```
python manage.py test
```

Then run the server, api endpoint should be available on http://localhost:8000/api

```
python manage.py runserver
```

## Running Frontend on Local Server

Start development server

```
cd frontend
yarn start
```

Frontend should be available on http://localhost:3000/

### Test User
By default, the database for development server in `backend/db.sqlite3` is already filled with some data for ease of development. The superuser id is `irene` and password is `irene` as well.

If you want to start clean. Delete `db.sqlite3` and follow this step in `backend folder`
```py
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
